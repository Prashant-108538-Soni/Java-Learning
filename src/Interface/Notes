JAVA Interface in depth :

- What is interface and How to define.
- Why we need interface.
- Methods in interface.
- Fields in an interface.
- Interface implementation.
- Nested interface.
- Difference between Interface and Abstract class.

JAVA 8 Interface features :

- Default method :
    How to handle the use-case when, class implements multiple interfaces have same name for the default method.
- Static method.
- Functional interface.

JAVA 9 Interface features :

- Private method.


1. What is interface ?

Ans -> Interface is something which helps 2 system to interact with each other, without one system has to
 know the details of other.
 Or, simply we can say interface helps in ABSTRACTION.

2. How to define Interface ?

Ans -> Interface declaration consist of :
        - Modifier
        - "interface" keyword
        - Interface name
        - Comma separated list of parent interfaces
        - Body
     Only public and Default Modifiers are allowed ( Protected and Private are not allowed )

     Example with Public Modifier :

     public interface Bird {

     // no usage.
     public void fly();
     }

     Example with Default Modifier :

     interface Bird {

     // no usage
     public void fly();
     }

     Comma separated list of parent interfaces ( it can extend from Class ) Example:

     public interface NonFlyingBirds extends Bird,LivingThings {

     // no usage
      public void canRun();
     }

3. Why we need an Interface ?

Ans -> 1. Abstraction : Using interface, we can achieve full Abstraction means, we can define WHAT class must do,
                        but not HOW it will do.

                        Example :
                        public interface Bird {

                            // no usage
                            public void fly();
                        }

        2. Polymorphism :
                        (i)  Interface can be used as a Data Type.
                        (ii) we cannot create the object of an interface, but it can hold the reference of all the
                             classes which implements it.And at runtime, it decide which method need to be invoked.

                             Example : 1 ( see code )

        3. Multiple Inheritance :
           In java Multiple inheritance is possible only through Interface only. A class cannot extend 2 different
           classes.

           In classes it is not allowed due to ambiguity ( complier gets confused ) to class function of which
           parent class.

           Diamond Problem :
           Example : 2 ( see code )

4. Methods in Interface :

- All Methods are implicitly public only.
- Method can not be declared as final.

public interface Bird
{
        // fly is also public by default
        // Method cannot be declared as final bcz if it is final then its child cannot able to override this.
        void fly();
        public void hasBeak();
}

5. Fields in Interface :

- Fields are public,static and final implicitly ( CONSTANTS ) // static and final used together to make a variable constant.
- You can not make field private or protected. // Implicitly they are public.


  Example :      1.   public interface Bird {

                    int MAX_HEIGHT_IN_FEET = 2000;
                    }

                 2.   public interface Bird {

                    public static final int MAX_HEIGHT_IN_FEET = 2000;
                    }

6. Interface Implementation :

- Overriding method can not have more restrict access specifiers.
- Concrete class must override all the methods declared in the interface.
- Abstract classes are not forced to override all the methods.
- A class can implement from multiple interfaces.


Ex of 1st point : In interface if a method is public it has to be public we cannot lower it down in child class.
                  Like : a method fly() in interface is public we cannot do it protected fly() in child class

Ex of 2nd point : Class which implement the interface must override all the method declared in the interface.

Ex of 3rd point : If abstract class implements an interface then overriding all methods of interface is not compulsory.But
                  concrete class must override all methods of parent.

7. Nested Interface : ( Less important )

- Nested interface declared within another interface.
- Nested interface declared within a class.

Generally it is used to group, logical related interfaced. And nested interface

Rules :

- A nested interface declared within an interface must be public.
- A nested interface declared within a class can have any access modifier.
- When you implement outer interface, inner interface implementation is not required and vice versa.

1. Interface within an Interface :

        public interface Bird
        {
            public void canFly();
            // Below interface must be public.
            public interface NonFlyingBird
            {
                public void canRun();
            }
        }

         public class Eagle implement Bird
         {
             @override
             public void canFly()
             {
                     // Implementation goes here.
             }
         }

        public class Eagle implement Bird.NonFlyingBird
        {
           @override
           public void canRun()
           {
             // Implementation goes here.
           }
        }



2. Interface within a class :


         public class Bird
         {
             protected interface NonFLyingBird
             {
                public void canRun();
             }
         }

8. Difference between Interface and Abstract class :


|S.No|                           Abstract class                                    |                               Interface                            |
| -- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1  | Keyword used here is abstract                                               | Keyword used here is interface
| 2  | Child class need to use keyword extends                                     | Child class need to use keyword implement
| 3  | It can have both abstract and non abstract method                           | It can have only abstract method ( from Java 8 onwards it can have default,
                                                                                     static and private method too, where we can provide implementation.
| 4  | It can Extend from Another class and multiple interfaces                    | It can only extends from other interfaces
| 5  | Variables can be static, non static, final, non final etc.                  | Variables are by default CONSTANTS.( public,static and final )
| 6  | Variables and Methods can be private, protected, public, default            | Variables and methods are by default public ( In Java 9, private method is supported )
| 7  | Multiple Inheritance is not supported                                       | Multiple Inheritance supported with this in JAVA.
| 8  | It can provide the implementation of the interface                          | It cannot provide implementation of any other interface or abstract class.
| 9  | It can have constructor                                                     | It cannot have constructor
| 10 | To declare the method abstract, we have to use abstract keyword ad it         No need for nany keyword to make method abstract. And be default its public.
        can be protected, public ad default.                                       |

                                                                     JAVA 8 & 9 INTERFACE FEATURE
                                                                     ****************************

1. Default Method ( JAVA 8 ) :

  - Before Java 8, interface can have only Abstract method. And all child classes has to provide abstract method implementation.
    Disadvantage of previous methods :  Any new method added in interface means need to change in all its implemented methods of child class.

    Example :
                        public interface Bird
                        {
                            // Every class which implement this interface must override canFly methods.
                            public void canFly();
                            // Need not override this. ( Can override based on requirement )
                            default int getMinimumFlyHeight()
                                {
                                     return 100;
                                }
                        }
